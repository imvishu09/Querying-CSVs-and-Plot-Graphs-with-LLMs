# Querying CSVs and Plot Graphs with LLMs

Welcome to the project repository for **Querying CSVs and Plot Graphs with LLMs**. This project demonstrates how to perform statistical analysis on CSV files and generate plots using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and integrate with a Language Model (LLM) for generating insights.

## About

This project is developed as an assignment for statistical analysis and data visualization using Python, with integration of a Language Model (LLM) to provide informative responses about the data queried.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to:
- Read and parse CSV files
- Perform basic statistical analysis (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, correlation coefficient)
- Generate various plots (histograms, scatter plots, line plots) based on the data
- Utilize a Language Model (LLM) to answer questions about the data in a comprehensive manner

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Transformers library (for LLM integration)

## Features

- **CSV Data Handling**: Reads and parses CSV files using Pandas.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates histograms, scatter plots, and line plots using Matplotlib.
- **LLM Integration**: Uses a Language Model (LLM) to answer questions about the data.
- **User Interaction**: Demonstration of interactive querying and visualization.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imvishu09/Querying-CSVs-and-Plot-Graphs-with-LLMs.git
   cd Querying-CSVs-and-Plot-Graphs-with-LLMs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure your CSV file is correctly formatted and located as specified in the `main.py` script (`file_path` variable).
2. Run `main.py` to execute the application.
3. Follow the prompts to perform statistical analysis, generate plots, and query the data using the integrated Language Model.

## Example Output

```python
# Example output or screenshots can be placed here
# Include outputs of statistical analysis, plots generated, and LLM responses.
```
